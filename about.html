				Content is king — we're all familiar with this old adage. Online content is so important that businesses are often willing to spend a fortune on hiring the best content creators to write for search engine optimization. Writing a great app description should be no different. You have to think in terms of keywords and key phrases that a potential user might search for. It makes a whole lot of difference as to how visible your app will be.

				Do a keyword research and look up your competitors’ strategies as well. If you haven’t already done so, there is a ton of good free advice out there on how to perform keyword research. Also, be sure to include long-tail keywords as those could be hidden gems to gaining organic traffic.
				
				Sit down and narrow down your lists of keywords. Identify at least 5 top keywords that you’d like to be associated with your app. Make good use of those keywords in all your web and digital content. After some time, review the data provided by your analytics software and figure out which keywords have been converting well for you. Then, update your app description accordingly using the effective keywords.
